# Personal C++ Project Setup with CMake and vcpkg

## Overview

This project is my personal C++ application set up using CMake for build system generator and vcpkg for package management. It provides a streamlined approach to dependency handling and cross-platform development.

## Prerequisites


Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc., but here I have MSVC)
- **CMake** (version 3.29 or later recommended)
- **vcpkg** (for package management)
- **Git** (to clone repositories and manage dependencies)
